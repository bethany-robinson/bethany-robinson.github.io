    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
      My biggest take away learning from week two has been about scss and sass. I had seen this through work, but didn't have much of an understanding about how it works and why it's useful.
      I found that playing with the diffeent options and seeing the video of how compiled css works to be really fascinating. I enjoyed the discussion assignment and the throught processes involved to 
      change the color of each box. It was interesting seeing the different approaches that people took as well as the couple of different directions I took on my own. 

      I also learned more about github and its uses. I had not used it to host web pages before and found this to be very interesting. Additionally, I created a new branch in the UI, which is not my 
      usual method of branch creation. I'm also enjoying the process of using Git with this class.
